## 9. Install Scope & EAC Requirement Guide

---

> *This guide explains where to install a mod and whether it is EAC friendly.*

---

### A. Install on Server, Client, or Both?
>   - **Server** - where the game is hosted. This could be your own PC if you are hosting the game yourself, or a game hosting service like Pingperfect.
>   - **Client** - your own PC.
> - Some mods only need to be in one place. Others need to be in both. Please see the Mod Types section below for exact requirements.

---

### B. EAC Friendly?

> - EAC stands for **Easy Anti-Cheat**. It's a program built into 7 Days to Die that helps protect multiplayer sessions from cheating.
> - Mod Type 1 is EAC friendly. Mod Types 2, 3, and 4 require EAC to be turned off.
> - Running without EAC opens up a wider range of mods and experiences. If you're running a multiplayer server without EAC, here are some good practices to keep things running smoothly:
>   - **Recommended practices when running multiplayer with EAC off:**
>     - Require a password and be conservative in distributing it.
>     - There are tools available such as ALOC and Server Tools to add extra protections.
>     - Optionally, require the whitelist system for the strictest limitation on who can join.
>     - Seek out other server hosts and discuss what they do.
>     - You can find help on AGF's Discord: [DISCORD](https://discord.gg/Vm5eyW6N4r)

### C. Mod Types

| # | Mod Type | What It Means |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Server-Side (EAC-Friendly) | Server install works for all joining players; EAC on or off. |
| 2 | Server-Side (EAC Off) | EAC off required; server install works for all joining players. |
| 3 | Server/Client-Side (Required) | EAC off required; host and joining players must install it. |
| 4 | Client-Side (Only) | EAC off required; server install has no effect; only the installing player gets the feature. |

## 10. Installation Guide

---

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️ Make a BACKUP!
> - If you are making changes to an existing game, ALWAYS make a backup first.
> - *(See the backup instructions further below.)*

---

### A. Special Note
> - The mod named **"0_TFP_Harmony"** is ***REQUIRED*** and should never be removed.
> - If it is missing, you can restore it by verifying your installation:
>    - *In Steam, right click on `7 Days to Die`*
>    - *Select "Properties"*
>    - *Select "Installed Files"*
>    - *Click on "Verify integrity of game files" and wait for completion.*

---

### B. Install to Your PC (Singleplayer, Hosting Friends, or Client-Required Mods)
> 1. **In Steam, right click `7 Days to Die`**
> 2. **Select `Manage`, then `Browse local files`**
> 3. **Open the `Mods` folder**
> 4. **Extract the mod into this `Mods` folder**
>    - *Final folder should look like: `Mods/<ModFolder>/ModInfo.xml`*
>    - *If the zip creates an extra parent folder, move the mod folder up one level*
> 5. **Keep `0_TFP_Harmony` in this folder**
>    - *It comes with the game and should remain in `Mods`*

---

### C. Install to a Dedicated Server *(hosted sites or player-run)*
> 1. **Find the main server folder**
>    - *If using a hosted site, use their file manager or a program like FileZilla*
> 2. **Open or create the `Mods` folder**
> 3. **Extract the mod into this `Mods` folder**
>    - *Final folder should look like: `Mods/<ModFolder>/ModInfo.xml`*

## 11. Removal Guide

---

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️ Make a BACKUP First!

---

---

### B. How do I remove mods?
> - The safest approach is to only remove mods when starting a new game.
> - ALSO smart to make a backup of the game (see below for instructions if needed).
>     - If you remove a mod that added new items or features, characters and/or the map may reset, or become permanently unplayable.
>     - If you are unsure, check the mod's readme for specific removal notes or ask in AGF's [DISCORD](https://discord.gg/Vm5eyW6N4r).
> - To remove, simply locate the mod folder and delete it. All done!
