## **A20 Vanilla Plus** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-A20VanillaPlus3.2.1.zip)

So many many many things. I am still working on how to explain this one even with pictures. Seriously awesome mod with TONS of hours and testing, data collecting, tweaking, etc etc. The overall goal is to simplify and enhance the vanilla experience.... and this is my iteration of that.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **A20 Cosmetic System** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-A20CosmeticSystem1.1.1.zip)

Look the way you want without sacrificing armor is the goal here. Cosmetic with no to minimal costs is my policy. Craft AND bundle dyes. Invisible Dye to hide clothing you don't wish to show. Orange Dye that follows the theme of the game. Facial Piercings are back. Cosmetic Mods to make armor appear like a different clothing article. Flashlight and Nightvision mods to go onto your helmet or chest, so you can have both. High Performance Running Soles mod.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **A20 Vehicles Plus** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-A20VehiclesPlus1.1.1.zip)

All vehicles speeds are increased slighty, as I felt the bicycle felt too slow to me. Each vehicle has 1 additional row of storage because I'm a hoarder. Expanded Seat Mod is now useless as you can always seat 2 people on the bicycle, minibike, and motorcycle. 5 can sit on the 4x4 like I had it since A18 and looks more comfortable than A20 settings. ALSO, gyrocopter seats 4 people. Yes, 4. ALSO ALSO, accidental / intentional jumping out of the gyrocopter removes fall damage, up to 8 seconds.

## **A20 Decoration Block** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-A20DecoBlock1.00.zip)

GREAT for the athetic enthusiasts. A single block that has shape options spanning across most of the models in the game. These models range from kitchen appliances, garage equipment, electricals, commercial, and decorative. Also, if they could be a container, they are, including the ones that "appear" open. 200 max hit points, and when they break you get the block back.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **A20 Quick Intro Quest** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-A20QuickIntroQuest1.01.zip)

Super quick start. You go into game, click continue, place the bedroll you have in your toolbelt, and BAM done. Time to head to trader and you have all the items and xp you would have as if you had gone through all the quests.... again.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **A20 Trader Hours** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-TraderHours1.00.zip)

Super simple mod that just makes the trader opens shortly after morning actually hits, at 4:05 instead of vanilla 6:05.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **A20 Death Penalty Reduction** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-A20DeathPenaltyEdit1.0.0.zip)

After turning on twitch integration and experiencing more pvp, I decided the death penalty needed to be reduced a bit. Vanilla is every time you die, you have to earn 25% of your xp to a max possible of 50%. My reduction makes it 10% xp to your max possible 30%.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **A20 More Zombies** - [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/AGF-MoreZombies1.0.0.zip)

Wandering Hordes are increased slighty to give that extra edge and NOT be too disruptive to gameplay or performance. Biome spawning that amplify the difficulty of each biome... except the Forest. Forest spawns more timid animals. Essentially, this creates a zombie environment where new and veteran players can find something fitting to them. Like vanilla, the biome porgression goes Forest -- Desert -- Snow -- Wasteland.

## **A20 AGF Small Modification of Khaine's 60 Slot Backpack**
Step 1: [Download](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FKhaineGB%2FKhaineA20ModletsXML%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FKHA20-60BBM) and install Khaine's 60 slot inventory mod.

Step 2: [Download](https://github.com/AuroraGiggleFairy/AuroraGiggleFairy.github.io/raw/main/KHA20-60BBM-AGFPatch1.0.0.zip) and install my patch.

Khaine is a legend among modders. My patch has minor alterations to his beautiful work. Lockable Slots are included and positioned differently. How the icons fit (by the pixel) I had adjusted to my anal retentive preference.
